•  Checklist for mailing your application to USCIS
Once you've requested a STEM recommendation through the U-M International Center and received your new I-20, you will need to prepare and submit an application packet to USCIS. Gather the following items in this order (from top to bottom): 
  •	G-1145, E-Notification of Application/Petition Acceptance
  •	Base Fee for I-765, payable to Department of Homeland Security. Personal check, cashiers check or money order is acceptable. If you use a personal check, please be sure to wait for the check to be cashed before closing your bank account.
  •	Two full-face passport-style photos. The photos must be identical and in color with a plain background. They must be no more than 30 days old when the I-765 is filed at USCIS. Put photos in an envelope or small plastic sandwich bag. You should attach the fee and the photo envelope on top of the entire application (on the upper left-hand corner). Please do not staple the fee and the photos. Use a pencil to gently write your name and SEVIS ID on the back of your photo.
  •	Original USCIS Form I-765 (completed, signed, and dated legibly by you). Please download and follow carefully these Instructions for Filling Out the I-765 for STEM Extensions.
  •	Photocopy of pages 1 and 3 of your new I-20 endorsed for the 17-month OPT extension. (Do not send the original.) Make sure to sign your new I-20 before you make the photocopy.
  •	Photocopy of the front and back of your current EAD card.
  •	Photocopy of your U-M diploma or official U-M transcript.
  •	Photocopy of paper or print-out of electronic Form I-94 (please click on the link for instructions).
  •	Photocopy of the picture page/expiration date of your passport.
USCIS will send you a notice for the receipt of your I-765 EAD (OPT) application (2-3 weeks). Once you have received your receipt notice, you can track the status of your individual case using the case status search feature of the USCIS web site. You may elect to receive email alerts about your case status from this web site.
•  Sending your application:
We recommend that you send your OPT application via U.S. Postal Service (USPS). There are four USCIS Service Centers in the United States that process I-765 (OPT) applications. The address you use on the I-765 determines where you should send your application (see I-765 instructions). 
•  If you successfully file the application for your 17-month OPT extension prior to the expiration of your current 12-month OPT period, you may continue employment even if your previous EAD card is expired until your OPT extension is processed or until 180 days has passed, whichever is sooner. 
•  If your OPT extension is approved, you must send a photocopy of your new EAD card to the IC at icenter@umich.edu. 
•  Please read During the 17-month OPT Extension below for more details on how to meet the requirements for properly maintaining your F-1 visa status.
